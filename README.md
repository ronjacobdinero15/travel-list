# Travel List App

This is a practice project.

## What I've Learned

- **React Fundamentals**: Understanding the core concepts of React including components, state, and props.
- **Importance of Keys**: Using unique keys in lists to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

Feel free to explore the code to see these principles in action!
